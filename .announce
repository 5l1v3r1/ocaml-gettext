Subject: [ANN] ocaml-gettext v0.3.0

Hello,

General:
ocaml-gettext is a library that enables string translation in OCaml.  The API
is based on GNU gettext. It comes with a tool to extract the string which needs
to be translated from OCaml source file.

This enable OCaml program to output string in the native language of the user
(if you also provide a file containing the translation of the english string
contains in the program to the one in the native language of the user).

The translation is base on string (this means that you need to provide a string
and not a unique identifier, like in some other catalog system). This string is
in english, and will be returned if the native language of the user doesn't
have translation catalog.

Changes:
v 0.3.0 has been long awaited but is now ready. It fix a lot of bugs concerning
merging PO and POT file (multiline comments, UTF-8...). This is also the first
release that works with camlp4 3.10. 

This new version doesn't need camlidl and ocaml-ast-analyze anymore, in order
to simplify installation. When building, it is also possible to not use
Camomile in favor of a simple gettext C library.
