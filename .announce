Subject: [ANN] ocaml-gettext v 0.2.0

Hello,

General :
Ocaml-gettext is a library that enables string translation in Ocaml. The
API is based on GNU gettext. It comes with a tool to extract the string
which needs to be translated from Ocaml source file.

This enable Ocaml program to output string in the native language of the
user ( if you also provide a file containing the translation of the 
english string contains in the program to the one in the native language 
of the user ).

The translation is base on string ( this means that you need to provide
a string and not a unique identifier, like in some other catalog 
system ). This string is in english, and will be returned if the native 
language of the user doesn't have translation catalog.

Changes:
v 0.2.0 is the first public release. Former release was simple wrapper
around GNU gettext. This release have a wrapper to GNU gettext AND a 
pure Ocaml implementation of the library ( based on Camomile ).
